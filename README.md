### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Apache server Mod_JK Worker Failures.
---

This incident type refers to failures with the Apache server's Mod_JK Worker, which is a module used to connect Apache to applications running on Tomcat. When this module fails, it can lead to issues with serving web pages and accessing web applications. This incident requires investigation and resolution to restore the proper functioning of the Apache server.

### Parameters
```shell
export APACHE_PORT_NUMBER="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_WORKERS_PROPERTIES="PLACEHOLDER"

export WORKER_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export TOMCAT_PORT_NUMBER="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_TOMCAT_LOGS="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check if Apache is running
```shell
systemctl status apache2
```

### Check if the Apache server is listening on the correct port
```shell
netstat -tulpen | grep ${APACHE_PORT_NUMBER}
```

### Check if the Mod_JK module is loaded in Apache
```shell
apachectl -M | grep mod_jk
```

### Check the Mod_JK configuration file for errors
```shell
apachectl configtest
```

### Check if the workers.properties file is correctly configured
```shell
cat ${PATH_TO_WORKERS_PROPERTIES} | grep worker.${WORKER_NAME}
```

### Check if the Tomcat server is running
```shell
systemctl status tomcat
```

### Check if the Tomcat server is listening on the correct port
```shell
netstat -tulpen | grep ${TOMCAT_PORT_NUMBER}
```

### Check the Tomcat server logs for errors
```shell
tail -f ${PATH_TO_TOMCAT_LOGS}
```

### Check if the firewall is blocking traffic to/from Apache or Tomcat
```shell
systemctl status firewalld
```

## Repair

### Restart the Apache server to see if that resolves the issue.
```shell


#!/bin/bash

sudo systemctl restart apache2

echo "Apache server has been restarted."
